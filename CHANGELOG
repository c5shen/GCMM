### WITCH v1.0.2a1
1. Fixed not using absolute path when setting up the directory for `main.config`.
2. Improved metavar naming for argument parameters.
3. Fixed a bug in the included MAGUS installation such that if the user has 
a file or directory named `fasttree/` in the folder where WITCH is run, MAGUS
will try to read it as the guide tree instead of creating a FastTree guide tree.

### WITCH v1.0.1
1. First working release across different platform and different python versions.
